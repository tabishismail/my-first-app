                                and others. It is important to me to live my life in a way that shows kindness,
                                care, and concern for family and friends and even strangers. Earn respect for myself
                                based on a recognition of my accomplishments and abilities, maintains a sense of
                                appreciation of the beauty of nature, and a sense of humor.I want to have a
                                career/life that includes constant learning and improvement for myself, but that
                                also creates an atmosphere of pleasurable learning and improvement for others.
                                I want to work with and around people, and it is important to me that they like me;
                                but it is even more important to me that they feel that I have helped them in some
                                way â€“ not necessarily that I do a specific good deed, but more that some kindness
                                or thoughtfulness or wisdom of mine has touched them.</p>
